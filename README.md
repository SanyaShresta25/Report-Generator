# 📊 Mini Report Generator

Welcome to the **Mini Report Generator** – your JavaScript-powered, no-nonsense (but kinda fun) dashboard for student score analysis! This project is a perfect showcase of how loops and array methods can work together to turn boring data into useful insights.

## ✨ What It Does

Ever had a bunch of student records and thought, “Wow, I wish JavaScript could handle this”? Well, now it can – and it does:

### 🔁 Print Student Names
Because names matter. A `for` loop does the honors.

### 🔄 Total Score of the First Student
Our friend the `while` loop crunches the numbers (one score at a time).

### 🎯 Score Fetching Simulator
A `do...while` loop plays the role of a stubborn fetcher – it keeps fetching until the score hits the sweet spot.

### 📋 Show Me the Scores!
Need to see all of Bob’s scores? `forEach()` makes it happen.

### 🔠 YELLING... I Mean, Uppercase Names
Who doesn’t love loud uppercase names? `map()` makes everyone SHOUT.

### 🧠 Filter the Brainy Bunch
`filter()` helps us spot the top dogs – students averaging above 75.

### 📉 Class Average Vibes
`reduce()` gathers all the data and whispers the class average like a wise math monk.
